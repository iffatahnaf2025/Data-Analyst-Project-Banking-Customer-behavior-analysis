## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **banking customer behavior** using transaction and demographic data to support **data-driven strategic decisions**.

By applying **Customer Profiling** and **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Segmentation**, the analysis aims to:
- Identify **high-value customers**
- Detect **loyalty potential**
- Highlight **customers at risk of churn**

All insights are translated into **actionable business and retention strategies**.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Understand customer characteristics based on **age, generation, and wealth category**
2. Segment customers using **RFM methodology**
3. Identify **potential loyal customers** and **high-risk churn customers**
4. Provide **practical and applicable strategic recommendations**
